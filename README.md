## Credits
This is basically the same kind of modding that was going on in ~2011, shoutout to various forum posts I might have visited to get a grasp on things.

[Halo Assembly](https://github.com/XboxChaos/Assembly) - This is the goto modding tool that everyone uses right now. The code however, is horrible and I made the mistake of trying to follow it. The most valuable things that you can find there are the .xml files that have the struct layouts for the classes. I try to perserve the credits in my port to cpp. (sidenote: we might have a tool soon that will let you use this w/ eac)

xbox7887 - The actual mastermind behind it all, little did we know, qemu-gang was just trying to keep up with him.
